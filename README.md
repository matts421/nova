| 1   | Rendering            | Textured geometry                                                                     | All sprites are rendered as quad geometries, textured mapped from a spritesheet. Our drawing order layers entities such that entities further to the camera (i.e. a lower y-value), are drawn first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |      |
| 2   | Rendering            | Basic 2D transformations                                                              | Through a motion component, every rendered entity has an associated position (translation), angle (rotation), and scale (size). These values are used to properly transform the sprites when rendered on-screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |      |
| 3   | Rendering            | Key-frame/state interpolation                                                         | Implemented a vignette effect. The fragment shader uses a uniform `darken_screen_factor` to illustrate the player's current health, and how much damage they have taken. The vignette darkens more as the player gets closer to death. The ovular shape of the vignette is achieved through Hermite interpolation, and the darkening from light to dark red of the vignette is done through linear interpolation of the background color to solid red. |      |
| 4   | Gameplay             | Keyboard/mouse control                                                                | The player can be moved with the arrow keys, and its direction, speed, and movement animation reflect these changes. Projectiles can also be shot by the player with a left-mouse click.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |      |
| 5   | Gameplay             | Random/coded action                                                                   | When an enemy is within range, the player's rocketship fires projectiles at enemies automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |      |
| 6   | Gameplay             | Well-defined game-space boundaries                                                    | The player is confined to the land within the spawn island. The player is only allowed to wade into shallow water, but going too far into the water is prohibited; this acts as a map-boundary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |      |
| 7   | Gameplay             | Simple collision detection & resolution                                               | The player can collide with the rocketship (which acts as a fixed barrier), or with enemies (which result in an elastic collision with knockback). Projectiles can also collide with enemies, at which point they are destroyed, and the enemy takes damage. The collision system supports both AABB rectangles, and circles for hitboxes.                                                                                                             |      |
| 8   | Stability            | Stable frame rate and minimal game lag                                                | Depending on the user's specific hardware, the game runs at a stable 90-120 FPS, with no degradation over time. This is displayed in the game window title.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | N/A  |
| 9   | Stability            | No crashes, glitches, or unpredictable behaviour                                      | The game runs predictably and smoothly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | N/A  |

This includes a new camera/view matrix in the vertex shaders. This allows for the camera to follow the player while exploring the map.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
